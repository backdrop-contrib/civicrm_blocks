# CiviCRM Blocks

This is module is in early development. It allows a user to insert a CiviCRM
Contribution page into a Backdrop Layout via a block.

## Installation

- Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

## Configuration and Usage

- Make sure CiviCRM is installed and you have one or more active Contribution Pages
set up.
- Install this module as usual
- Add the "CiviCRM Contribution Page" block to a region in a Layout
- Select an active Contribution page
- Adjust title, visibility settings, etc. as usual

When you view that Layout, if visibility settings on the block allow, it should
pull the CiviCRM contribution page directly in to the Layout in question.
